# Getting Started with GitHub Codespaces

Start coding in the cloud with GitHub‚Äôs powerful, browser-based editor.

## Goal

By the end of this lesson, you‚Äôll have a live static website running in a GitHub Codespace, all from your browser.

<video src="assets/goal-completed.mp4" autoplay loop muted playsinline></video>

## Set Up GitHub

First, you'll need a GitHub account.

- Go to <a href="https://github.com" target="_blank">https://github.com</a>
- Click "Sign up" and follow the prompts

Already have an account? You're good to go!

## 1. Create a Repository

**Goal**: Set up a new project on GitHub using a ready-made template.

<video src="assets/create-repo-from-template.mp4" autoplay loop muted playsinline></video>

A repository (or "repo") is where your project lives.

We‚Äôve made a starter project template for you: üëâ <a href="https://github.com/dpi-tta-projects/static-html-template" target="_blank">static-html-template</a>

Click "Use this template" to begin.

![use this template button](assets/use-this-template.png)

Then:

- Name your repo (e.g., `my-first-app`)
- Set visibility: **Public** or **Private**

<aside class="warning">You'll need to make your repository "public" in order for others to access your repository.</aside>

- Click Create repository

<aside class="tip">
  <strong>Naming convention:</strong> Use lowercase letters and dashes (e.g., <code>my-first-app</code>). This style is called <strong>kebab-case</strong> and is commonly used in web development.
</aside>

## 2. Launch a Codespace

**Goal**: Open your GitHub project in a cloud-based development environment ‚Äî no setup required.

![create codespace on main](assets/create-codespace-on-main.png)

Go to your new repo and:

- Click the green "Code" button
- Select the "Codespaces" tab
- Click "Create codespace on main"

Your browser will open a full development environment, no installs required!

<aside class="warning">
  Be patient. The first time you load a codespace may take a few minutes. Subsequent loads will be much faster.
</aside>

## 3. Explore the Codespace

**Goal**: Learn your way around the Codespace layout so you know where to find and write your code.

![codespace layout](assets/vscode.png)

Here‚Äôs a quick tour of the layout:

- **Explorer** (left panel): your files
- **Editor** (center panel): where you write code
- **Terminal** (bottom panel): run commands
- **Tabs** (top): open files

<aside class="tip">
  Shortcut to toggle <strong>Terminal</strong>:
  <ul>
    <li>
      <code>Ctrl + J</code> (Windows/Linux)
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>‚åò + J</code> (Mac)
    </li>
  </ul>
  <video src="assets/shortcut-toggle-terminal.mp4" autoplay loop muted playsinline></video>

    </li>
  </ul>
  <video src="assets/shortcut-toggle-explorer.mp4" autoplay loop muted playsinline></video>
</aside>

## 4. Start a Local Server

**Goal**: Run a local development server to view your project in the browser.

<video src="assets/starting-http-server-and-port.mp4" autoplay loop muted playsinline></video>

In the terminal, type:

```bash
python -m http.server 3000
```
{: .copyable }

<aside class="tip">
  This command starts a lightweight web server on port 3000 ‚Äî ideal for serving static files like HTML and CSS.
</aside>

<aside>
  <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.server.html" target="_blank">üìò Docs: http.server</a>
</aside>

GitHub will show a URL (a "forwarded port") to preview your site. Click the ports tab in the bottom panel. Click on the üåê icon to open your app in a browser tab.

![ports tab](assets/ports.png)

<aside class="tip">
  If you'd like to access your app from any device, set the port visibility to <strong>public</strong>. This way you can access your app from your phone and share the link with friends.
</aside>

<aside class="tip">

<img src="assets/directory-listing.png" alt="server directory listing">

When you visit your Codespace preview and see <code>Directory listing for /</code>, it means your web server is running, but there‚Äôs no <code>index.html</code> file present.

Web servers look for a default file to show ‚Äî usually <code>index.html</code>. If it‚Äôs missing, the server shows a list of files and folders in your project instead. This is called a "directory listing".

Once you add <code>index.html</code>, that file will be shown automatically instead of the listing.

</aside>

<aside class="tip">
  Stop your server by entering <code>Ctrl + C</code> in the terminal. This works with most terminal processes. If all else fails, you can also close the terminal running the process.
</aside>

<aside class="tip">
  <img src="assets/create-kill-terminal.png" alt="Create or Kill Terminal Instance">

  In the terminal tab, click `+` to create additional terminal instances. You can also click the trash icon to destroy the terminal instance.
</aside>

## 5. Add an index.html Page

**Goal**: Create your first web page and see it live in the browser.

<video src="assets/create-index-html.mp4" autoplay loop muted playsinline></video>

Create a new file named `index.html` and add:

```html
<h1>Hello, world!</h1>
```
{: .copyable }

Refresh the preview to see it live.

<aside>
  Why <code>index.html</code>? It‚Äôs the default page that web servers serve when you visit a folder path like `/`. Think of it like a "table of contents" for your website.
</aside>

<aside class="tip">
  Use the vs code explorer 'new file' and 'new folder' buttons.

  <img src="assets/explorer-new-file-folder.png" alt="vscode explorer new file / folder">
</aside>

<aside>
  üõ†Ô∏è Try It: Edit your h1 to say your name, like: <code>Hello from Ian!</code>. Then refresh your preview tab to see your personalized message.
</aside>

## 6. Create a `bin/server` Script

**Goal**: Automate server startup with a simple script so you can launch your app with one command.

<video src="assets/create-bin-server.mp4" autoplay loop muted playsinline></video>

Let‚Äôs automate our server start-up.

Make a folder called `bin`. Inside `bin`, create a file called `server`.

Paste this code:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

python -m http.server 3000
```
{: .copyable }

In terminal, run:

```bash
chmod +x bin/server
```
{: .copyable }

<aside class="tip">
  The <code>chmod +x</code> command makes your script executable, meaning you can run it like a regular program.
</aside>

Now you can start your server using this script by typing `bin/server` in the terminal and hitting enter.

```bash
bin/server
```
{: .copyable }

<aside class="tip">
  The <code>bin</code> folder is a convention for small executable scripts. The <code>#!/usr/bin/env</code> line (a "shebang") tells the system which interpreter to use for the script. (in our case, <code>bash</code>, the same shell we use in the terminal)
</aside>

## 7. Save Your Work with Git

**Goal**: Save your project changes and push them to GitHub so your work is safely backed up online.

<aside class="warning">
  Codespaces are temporary environments. Saving your code is not enough, you must commit and push to GitHub to avoid losing your work.
</aside>

You'll notice your new files will appear in <span class="text-success">green</span> color.

![explorer diff green](assets/explorer-diff.png)

The source control tab in the left pane will also indicate that you have '2 pending changes'.

![source control indicator](assets/source-control-indicator.png)

There are two ways to save your work to GitHub:

- (a) Use the VS Code Source Control Tab (beginner-friendly)
- (b) Use Git commands in the terminal (if you're comfortable with the command line)

Both methods achieve the same result.

### 7.1 (a) In the VS Code Source Control Tab

<video src="assets/source-control-tab-commit-push-sync.mp4" autoplay loop muted playsinline></video>

Click the Source Control icon (looks like a branch).

![source control icon](assets/source-control-icon.png)

- Stage the files you want to commit (click the '+' next to each file)
- Write a commit message "Add index.html with hello world and bin/server script"
- Click '‚úì Commit' to commit
- Click 'Sync Changes' to push to GitHub

<aside>
  Committing your code saves a snapshot. Pushing it sends that snapshot to GitHub where it can be safely stored long term.
</aside>

Your code is now saved online!

### 7.1 (b) In the terminal

Use `git status` to see the status of your changes:

```bash
git status
```
{: .copyable }

You'll see an output like this:

```bash
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        bin/
        index.html

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

Let's 'stage' the files we just created so we can commit and push to GitHub.

<aside class="tip">
  You will only "commit" files that have been staged first.
</aside>

```bash
git add index.html
git add bin/server
```
{: .copyable }

<aside class="tip">
  Use the tab key to autocomplete file and folder names in the terminal. ‚è±Ô∏è This is a HUGE time saver.
</aside>

Let's see the status of our changes now using `git status`. You should see an output like this:

```bash
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
        new file:   bin/server
        new file:   index.html
```

We've now "staged" our files. Let's commit our changes and push to GitHub.

```bash
git commit -m "Add index.html with hello world and bin/server script"
```
{: .copyable }

You'll see an output like this confirming the commit. This means we've committed locally.

```bash
[main 935f4e3] Add index.html with hello world and bin/server script
 2 files changed, 4 insertions(+)
 create mode 100755 bin/server
 create mode 100644 index.html
```

<aside class="tip">
  Enter <code>git log</code> in the terminal to see your commit history.
</aside>

Now we're ready to push to our commits to GitHub. Enter this Git command in the terminal:

```bash
git push
```

If successful you'll see an output like this:

```bash
Enumerating objects: 6, done.
Counting objects: 100% (6/6), done.
Delta compression using up to 2 threads
Compressing objects: 100% (2/2), done.
Writing objects: 100% (5/5), 458 bytes | 458.00 KiB/s, done.
Total 5 (delta 1), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0 (from 0)

To https://github.com/heratyian-tta/hello-world
   5cf5cfb..935f4e3  main -> main
```

Your code is now safely saved online!

<aside class="tip">
  Once a file has been committed and is being tracked by Git, use <code>git diff</code> to compare your changes with the previous commit.

  <pre>
    <code>
      diff --git a/index.html b/index.html
      index 6b5d288..ee9e459 100644
      --- a/index.html
      +++ b/index.html
      @@ -1 +1 @@
      -<h1>Hello, world!</h1>
      \ No newline at end of file
      +<h1>Hello, world!!!</h1>
      \ No newline at end of file
    </code>
  </pre>
</aside>

### 7.2 Confirm In GitHub

Go to your repo in GitHub to verify your files have been properly staged, committed, and pushed. You should now see the `index.html` and `bin/server` files in GitHub.

<aside class="tip">
  Enter <code>git remote -v</code> in the terminal to get a link to your repository in GitHub.
</aside>

![github repo completed](assets/completed-repo.png)

<aside class="tip">
  <strong>Write commit messages like you're telling a teammate what changed.</strong> Use the present tense (e.g., "Add homepage" or "Fix broken link") and keep it short but clear. Aim for what changed and why ‚Äî not just "update" or "stuff" or "changes".
</aside>

<aside class="warning">
  If you forget to add a commit message (like just typing <code>git commit</code> without `-m`), Git will open a special screen called <code>COMMIT_EDITMSG</code>. This can be confusing.

  All commits must have a message. So, if you see this pop up, just type your message, save, and close the tab.

  <!-- `Ctrl + X`, then `Y`, then `Enter` if you're in nano. -->
  <video src="assets/commit_edtmsg_gui.mp4" autoplay loop muted playsinline></video>
</aside>

<aside class="danger">
  Each GitHub user gets limited free hours for Codespaces. To manage or delete your environments:

  <ol>
    <li>Go to <a href="https://github.com/codespaces" target="_blank">https://github.com/codespaces</a></li>
    <li>Click the "..." next to a Codespace to stop or delete it</li>
  </ol>

  Deleting unused Codespaces frees up your quota and prevents unnecessary charges.
</aside>

## Recap

You just:

- ‚úÖ Created a GitHub repo from a template
- ‚úÖ Launched a Codespace
- ‚úÖ Ran a live web server
- ‚úÖ Wrote an HTML page
- ‚úÖ Pushed your code to GitHub

You now have a live web development environment in the cloud!

## Practice Challenge

- Add an `<h2>` subtitle
- Include a `<p>` paragraph with a message
- Use the terminal to commit and push your changes
- Create additional HTML files (like `about.html`) and open them at `/about.html` in your browser.
- Bonus: Link to your new pages using `<a>` links
